### THREAD SUPPORT LIBRARY ###

MUTEX AND AFFINITY:

    *** lock unlock multi thread application we can use conflict
    *** try_lock -> if mutex not lock make lock else return false
    *** std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mutex) -> automatically unlock when getting out off scope
    *** cpu affiniy using with native_handle and we can use with shared ptr and using with pthread_setaffinity_np
    *** if your thread function no member use like => thread(std::bind(&Process::doProcess, process)));  process => std::shared_ptr<Process> process(new Process());
