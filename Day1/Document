Makefile is generally using C/C++ project's build options. In the Linux systems using
make command, otherwise Windows systems using nmake tools.

Makefiles is mostly output program's source has code compiling, linking, dependency, cleanall, clean, make all options.
A lot of big project has own Makefile and build system(configure). 
** makefile is overrun Makefile !!
Let's start.

================================================
Makefile struct,

TARGET: dependency
[1 TAB] command 1
[1 TAB] command 2

Makefile is using source code's change time. Ä°f source file changed for a time rebuild again otherwise makefile files not run 
unnecessary.

================================================
Makefile example:

all: deploy

build: 
    echo "Build all"

unit_test:
    echo "Running unit test tool"

deploy:
    echo "deploy to target"
    echo "command 2" -> second command
    echo "command 3" -> third command

clean:
    rm -r *.o

Warning!!! : Be sure using 1 TAB

================================================
Example's usage:
copy Makefile.1 as Makefile and run 
$make command

================================================
PHONY
if you want always Makefile overrun mode add to PHONY
mode to Makefile
